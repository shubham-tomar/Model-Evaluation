# Model-Evaluation

--> In this data analysis Project I've build CART and C5.0 model for the prediction of Loans(Which coustomer will get a loan and which will not).

--> I've used following charts for evaluation of two models :
    * Lift Chart
    * Gain Chart
    * Response Chart
    * Profile Chart
    * ROI chart
    
--> After understanding all charts i came to the conclusion that C5.0 model is better
    than CART model for the Loan approval.
